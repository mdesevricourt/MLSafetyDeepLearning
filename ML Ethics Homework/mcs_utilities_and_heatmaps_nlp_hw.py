# Saliency Map for NLP (heatmap)

We begin with learning about how to generate heatmaps to visualize a per token model explanation.  We will be using the package `thermostat` which provides a score per token.  Later in the homework you will investigate creating that score yourself by computing the gradients.

We're going to load the DeBERTa model to see how to generate heatmaps from a model instead of using pregenerated model outputs.  

The basic plan we will be following is detailed below.

1.  We will be loading the model and corresponding tokenizer.  Note that the model and tokenizers go hand in hand.
1.  We will compute the gradients of the model and write up a description of what it means.
1.  We will recreate the above renderer to be able to display the utility of each word.
1. We will be examining some inconsistencies or failures of current language models.
1. We will ask you to see if you can discover any other inconsistencies yourself.

Pytorch and more recent libraries like HuggingFace makes the abstractions for running machine learning models very user friendly.  However it is important to be able to understand how the gradients are computed and how you can manipulate gradients and so on. 

Specifically what we're asking you to complete below mimics very closely to what you have previously done when feeding the gradients into the optimizer.  It might be helpful to revisit those concepts as a refresher to have a better understanding of when and how the gradients are computed before being passed into the optimizer: see [optimizer class docs](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/optim.html#:~:text=This%20is%20a%20simplified%20version%20supported%20by%20most%20optimizers.%20The%20function%20can%20be%20called%20once%20the%20gradients%20are%20computed%20using) and [understanding loss backward](https://stackoverflow.com/a/53975741).
